  We realize that a lot of the time, creation involves
  simply sending a create request to the database (with the
  request body). Rather than duplicating this across every
  controller, we simply abstract it to a factory function that
  takes in a model. This way, you can create several models
  with a single line.

  If custom logic is needed for creation, we would either
  NOT use this factory function (and instead define our own),
  or register another middleware function BEFORE this one (which
  performs the additional logic).

# ApliTrack

Running the server:

1. Clone the REPO (top right should have a `Code` button; click that, and then paste the command in terminal or use GitHub Desktop to clone). DO NOT DOWNLOAD ZIP.
1. Install NPM and NodeJS online (just look for an install)
2. `cd` into the  `Apli-Track/server` directory
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm run start:dev` to start the server up. You're now able to send requests to localhost:3000/URL (where `URL`)
   is the URL of one of the endpoints in our application. For example, localhost:3000/api/auth.

Install the following VSCode Extensions:
1. ESLint (make sure to read an article on how to enable it for your files after installing)
2. Prettier (make sure to read on how to enable it for your files after installing)
3. SQLite (explore and query SQLite databases). https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alexcvzz.vscode-sqlite
   SQLite lets you look at the tables in a DB by right clicking a `.db` file and clicking the `Open Database` option.
